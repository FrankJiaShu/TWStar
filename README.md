# TWStar
2017-11-10 I wanna build a project which could manage NWU's dancing crew.And I believe,it should be a system called TWStar.

2017-11-13 Add spring MVC framework designed in TWStar.

2017-11-19 Now it's a SSM(springmvc+spring+mybatis) project with JSTL. Of course,MySql is my default database.when it's comes to provide datasource,I  choose the Durid developed by alibaba which has a high-level-performance in my company.

2017-11-30 The project could create new account for my crews,fantastic~ I changed the main jsp,added ajax in it,so that they could response faster in our browser or explorer.
